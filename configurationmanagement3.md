# Configuration Management - Homework #3

## Assignment
z) Read and summarise the article with a few French lines. This z subsection does not require any computer testing.

[Commonmark contributors: Markdown Reference](https://commonmark.org/help/) (note at least headings with hyphens, paragraph breaks on blank lines, indentation (tab) code, list, link, image.

a) MarkDown. Make a report of this assignment as a MarkDown. It is easiest to make the report in a GitHub repository, so that md-ended files are automatically formatted. A blank line makes the paragraph division, a dash '#' makes the title, an indent marks the code snippet.

b) Pull first. Make several changes to your git repository. Make a few changes where one commit applies to multiple files. Give a good description (commit message), one English sentence in imperative (imperative form) "Add top level menu to Foobar synchronizer"

b) All recorded. In your git repository, show examples of the commands 'git log', 'git diff' and 'git blame'. Explain the results.

c) Huppis! Make a stupid change to git, don't commit. Destroy bad changes with 'git reset --hard'. Note that there is no undo button for this action.

d) Formula. Make a new salt mode (formula, module, infra as code). (i.e. a new file e.g. /srv/salt/terontila/init.sls). You can do a simple couple of functions (pkg, file...), or more advanced, install and configure any new program: a daemon, a desktop program, or a program running from a command prompt. If necessary, use 'find -printf "%T+ %p\n"|sort' to find new configuration files.

f) Optional: put srv/salt/ in git. Make a new module. Clone your repository to another machine (or remove srv/salt and restore it by cloning) and continue with that.

e) Optional: Own dog food. Adjust one of the machines you are using with Salt.
